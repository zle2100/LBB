                        from you. Which ones are the worst?</strong></h2>
                </center>
                <p> Lightbulbs are tiny, cheap devices that we rarely think about. Despite hanging above our heads on a constant basis, the technology behind these bulbs is
                    evolving continuously. Hackers and bad actors are counting on consumers not imagining lightbulbs as vulnerable honeypots of personal information. Bulbs are cheap, ubiquitous, and seemingly harmless, which is why they are an unsuspecting ground for malfeasance. It also doesn’t take a tech genius to crack into one. 
                    Smart bulbs are low hanging fruit for hackers, dangling just above our heads every day.</p>
                    
                   
                   <p>  The basic guards you have from these predations are full of holes, as we discovered when we surveyed the smart bulb market with a computer assisted analysis of Amazon’s top brands. Manufacturers can provide voluminous detail on the steps it takes to make sure that devices do not collect data from you that they should not. However, many just don’t and many others use language so ambiguous it is pointless.</p>

                   <p>  Smart lightbulbs- any lightbulb that connects to the internet- are part of what tech insiders refer to as The Internet of Things (IoT). These devices are linked to the internet, usually through a mobile app, to provide some type of added functionality. Changing color, turning on and off with a phone, or playing music are all popular add-ons. Though, with each added role they become more susceptible and valuable to hackers.</p>
                    
                  <p>   In a sampling of <strong> 66 </strong> smart bulb brands listed on Amazon.com, a distinct pattern began to form. The bulbs had a common point of origin. Famous manufacturers of pre-IoT bulbs like Philips may ring a bell, but there are countless unknown brands littering the Amazon.com smart bulb sales page. These new devices can generally be traced back to one region in China that has dominated the IoT market.</p>

                     <p>“There just is a lack of attention to security and quality and often the apps and other features the software that is being built on top of this developers will literally copy and paste sample code from the manufacturer.”,said Paul Roberts, founder and Editor in Chief of The Security Ledger, an independent security news website that explores the intersection of cyber security with the Internet of Things.
 </p>
 <p>This fact is evident from the fact that over half of the bulbs suggested the user download either the “Smart Life App” or “Magic Home App”.

<p> “The driving force there[China] is getting products on the shelves”,said Roberts.</p> 

<p> The majority of the bulbs in this study came from a brands that registered a trademark with the United States Trademark and Patent Office (USTPO). 64%of these brands were registered to a Chinese company.

                    “The supply chain for any consumer electronics maker in the US starts in China. Very few components are manufactured in the US”,said Roberts.
  </p>
 <p> The dominance of these Chinese products in Amazon’s store is two-fold. These Chinese companies have the business flexibility to produce cheaper goods in a variety of electronic categories and the massive amount of products sold on Amazon can mask malfeasance for a short time. While Amazon deploys numerous safeguards to make sure that these types of goods are removed, some working in the industry believe there are many that slip through the cracks.
   </p>
     <p> “The supply chain for any consumer electronics maker in the US starts in China. Very few components are manufactured in the US”,said Roberts.
  </p>
<p> “Though I’m solely a domestic originator/seller, to my knowledge, there is no formalized vetting process for international sellers selling in the US (the EU is a different story; tons of red tape) that I’m aware of. International sellers only need a domestic bank account and unique email address to set up an account and start selling.”, said Nicholas Klaiber, President of the e-commerce branding firm, Klybee.
 </p>

                <p> Amazon’s policies towards international sellers have been especially potent in sparking Chinese competition.
</p>
                
<p>“Specifically, Chinese sellers can syndicate cheaper goods and undercut domestic based sellers selling a product that is not gated/protected by its trademark. The only ‘vetting’ that Amazon deploys is on the backend once customer complaints are received. If the customer complains that the purchased product feels like a knock-off, Amazon will then delete the listing and reprimand the seller.”, said Klaiber.

<p>
 Almost 80% of the bulbs registered to Chinese companies were registered from Shenzen, China. While the region’s name may be unfamiliar to some, the area has been the powerhouse of second tier electronics for the past few years.

                  “China is where there is an ecosystem of parts makers”,said Roberts.    </p> 
 <p> 
                
The proximity and abundance of electronic devices in these overseas areas leads to a lack of variety among products and software. If one piece of technology is vulnerable to hacking, it is likely that many other share the same design- and flaw.

     </p> 
     
<p> “When you peel back the covers of a story about a vulnerable webcam, home router, digital video recorder, smart watch, often what you find is a short list of companies that make let's say cameras in China and make them for many many manufacturers and companies and often the firmware that they are using, the hardware that they are using is the same.”, said Roberts.
  </p> 
     
<p>“It’s almost like a salmonella outbreak or something. If you have a remotely exploitable vulnerability with their firmware made by a firm in China that basically supplies 2/3 of the webcams out there it will be a pretty widespread problem.”, said Roberts.
</p> 
                
<p>Though tracing back these problems and placing the blame is exceedingly difficult to trace.
</p> 

<p>
“If we buy our lettuce from Mexico and there is a Salmonella outbreak in California is that a Mexican Salmonella outbreak our Mexico?”, asked Roberts.
